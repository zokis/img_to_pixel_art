# Optimized Pixel Art Creator

## Introduction
This project contains a Python script that transforms any image into pixel art. The script analyzes the image and determines the best block size for the pixel art based on color homogeneity. It also allows specifying a block size manually. The resulting pixel art image maintains the essential features and colors of the original image, but with a unique pixelated aesthetic.

## Installation
To run this script, you need Python installed on your machine. Clone this repository and navigate into the project directory. Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
